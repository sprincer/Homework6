              <li>  Story: I'd type a story, but a really good one comes to mind, and I
      would rather let Chuck Palahniuk tell it than me try to type out all of the details.
      I'll try to link the time exactly but if it doesn't work goto: 17:12

              <li>  I recommend watching the rest of that video but the other stories are a little
        rougher than that one. Hopefully you enjoy?

              <li>  Art: I can't figure out how to put pictures in here :(</li>
